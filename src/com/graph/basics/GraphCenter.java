/**
 * <h1>Find Center of Star Graph</h1>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n.
 * A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1
 * edges that connect the center node with every other node. You are given a 2D
 * integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an
 * edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Constraints: 3 <= n <= 10^5 edges.length == n - 1 edges[i].length == 2 1 <=
 * ui, vi <= n ui != vi The given edges represent a valid star graph. Example:
 * 
 * <p>
 * Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]] Output: 2 Explanation: As shown in the
 * figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
 * 
 * Expected Time Complexity : O( E )
